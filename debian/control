Description: Interface to Liip's Zebra
 Taxi is a new interface for Zebra, based on TKS.
 .
 Its main advantages are :
   - Easy to install
   - Written in Python (yes, that's an advantage !)
   - Quite extensible
   - More complete
 .
 Basically, Taxi allows you to do the following :
   - Parse timesheets and have a summary for each day
   - Create new timesheets
   - Search for projects and their activities
   - Record time spent on an activity
